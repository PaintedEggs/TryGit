Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant; April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) was the 18th President of the United States (1869–1877). As commanding general, Grant led the Union Armies to victory over the Confederacy in the American Civil War, which ended shortly after Robert E. Lee surrendered to him at Appomattox in 1865. After the war, Grant served as commanding general, implementing Congressional Reconstruction, often at odds with President Andrew Johnson. Twice elected president, Grant led the Radical Republicans in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect African-American citizenship, and defeat the Ku Klux Klan.
Grant graduated in 1843 from the United States Military Academy at West Point and served in the Mexican–American War. When the Civil War began in 1861, he rejoined the Union Army. In 1862, Grant took control of Kentucky and most of Tennessee, and led Union forces to victory in the Battle of Shiloh, earning a reputation as an aggressive commander. Grant incorporated displaced African American slaves into the Union war effort. In July 1863, after a series of coordinated battles, Grant defeated Confederate armies and seized Vicksburg, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River and dividing the Confederacy in two. After victory in the Chattanooga Campaign in late 1863, President Lincoln promoted him to lieutenant general and commander of all the Union Armies. Grant confronted Lee in a series of bloody battles in 1864. The press criticized Grant for losses of men. Lee's army was then trapped at Petersburg, Virginia. During the siege, Grant coordinated a series of devastating campaigns launched by generals William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip Sheridan, and George Henry Thomas in other theaters. Finally, breaking through Lee's trenches, Grant captured Richmond in April 1865. Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox as the Confederacy collapsed. Historians have hailed Grant's military genius and his strategies are featured in the military history textbooks, but a minority contend that he won by brute force rather than superior strategy.
After the Civil War, Grant was Commanding General under President Johnson and led the U.S. Army's supervision of Reconstruction in the former Confederate states. Grant was elected president in 1868 and reelected in 1872. He worked to stabilize the nation during the turbulent Reconstruction period and the contested election of 1876. He enforced civil rights laws and destroyed the Ku Klux Klan. Grant encouraged passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, protecting African-American voting rights. He used the army to build the Republican Party in the South, based on black voters, Northern newcomers ("Carpetbaggers"), and native Southern white supporters ("Scalawags"), and for the first time in American history, African-Americans were elected to Congress and high state offices. While Grant was president, the Republican coalitions in the South fell apart and conservative Democrats regained control of each Southern state. Although Grant's Indian peace policy sought to reduce Indian violence, fighting continued that culminated in George Custer's defeat at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876. Throughout his presidency, Grant was faced with Congressional investigations into federal corruption, including bribery charges against two of his Cabinet members. Grant's economic policy resulted in deflation and implementation of a gold standard. In foreign policy, Grant sought to increase American trade and influence, while remaining at peace with the world. In 1872 most of the reformers in the Republican Party opposed his reelection and formed the new Liberal Republican Party; Grant was reelected in a landslide. His second term saw the Panic of 1873, gold discovered in the Black Hills, and the Great Sioux War, while conservative white Southerners regained control of Southern state governments and Democrats took control of the federal House of Representatives.
Led by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, the administration resolved issues with Great Britain and ended bitter wartime tensions. It settled the Alabama Claims whereby the British paid $15 million for the damages done by the Confederate warship Alabama. Grant avoided war with Spain over the Virginius Affair, but his attempted annexation of the Dominican Republic was rejected by Congress. His response to the Panic of 1873 gave some financial relief to New York banking houses, but was ineffective in halting the five-year economic depression that produced high unemployment, low prices, low profits and high rates of bankruptcy. As a result his Republican party was badly defeated in the 1874 elections. In 1880, after returning from a widely praised worldwide tour, he made an unsuccessful bid for a third presidential term. His memoirs, written as he was dying, were a critical and popular success, and his death prompted an outpouring of national mourning. Since he left office, few presidents' reputations have changed as dramatically as his. The late 19th century saw high opinion of his presidency among historians, which shifted to a low opinion for much of the 20th century, before recovering beginning in the 1980s. His critics frequently point to the misadventure of his failed Dominican Republic annexation, his economic management of the nation after the Panic of 1873, and corruption issues under his administration. His admirers frequently point to greater appreciation for his commitment to civil rights, moral courage in his prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan, enforcement of voting rights, and his personal integrity.
