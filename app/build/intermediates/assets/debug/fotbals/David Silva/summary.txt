David Josué Jiménez Silva (Spanish pronunciation: [daˈβið ˈsilβa] English pronunciation: /dɑːˈbid-ˈsilbɑː/; born 8 January 1986) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for English club Manchester City and the Spanish national team. Silva plays mainly as an attacking midfielder but can also play as a winger or second striker.
A Spanish international since the age of 20, he was an integral member of the squads that won three consecutive international tournaments — UEFA Euro 2008, 2010 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2012 — the first time a European team has achieved such a feat.
Silva spent six years of his professional career with Valencia CF, appearing in more than 150 games and winning one Copa del Rey in 2008, before moving in the summer of 2010 to Manchester City. His passing ability and possession-retaining qualities have earned him the nicknames "Merlin" and "El Mago" from his teammates and fans. Since joining City, Silva has appeared in over 150 games in three seasons, winning the FA Cup, Football League Cup and Premier League.
