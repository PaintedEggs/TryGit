Javier Adelmar Zanetti (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈχaβ̞je̞ɾ saˈne̞ti]; born 10 August 1973) is an Argentine former footballer. He played most of his career for the Italian Serie A club Internazionale, from 1995 to 2014, and served as their captain from 1999, earning him the nickname "Il Capitano" (The Captain). Known for his versatility, he was adept on both the left and right wing, having played on both flanks as a fullback, as well as a winger. He could also play as a defensive or central midfielder. On retiring, the club retired his number 4 jersey and named him as Vice President.
Known as "Pupi" in Argentina, Zanetti was born in Buenos Aires, picking up the nickname "El Tractor" (The Tractor) soon after his move to Italy where his strength, resilience, stamina, and his ability to run past opposing defenders when joining the attack from his right back position earned him reverence. Zanetti won honours including five Serie A and four Coppa Italia titles with Inter.The 2010 UEFA Champions League Final on 22 May 2010 was Zanetti's 700th game with Inter, and the team's victory on the night made him the only captain to win a treble with an Italian club. Internationally, he holds the record of the most capped player in the history of the Argentine national team and played in the 1996 Olympic tournament, five Copa América tournaments and two World Cups, in 1998 and 2002.
As of the 2011–12 season, he is the only non-Italian player to captain a Serie A team. He holds the record for the highest all-time appearances by a non-Italian born player for an Italian club and his 858 official matches for the club put him first in Inter's all-time appearances list. He is also noted for his charity work, running a foundation to benefit disadvantaged children in Argentina. He has been named an ambassador for the SOS Children's Villages project in Argentina by FIFA, and in 2005, he received the Ambrogino d'Oro award from the Milan town hall for his social initiative. Zanetti is also a Global Ambassador for Special Olympics.
