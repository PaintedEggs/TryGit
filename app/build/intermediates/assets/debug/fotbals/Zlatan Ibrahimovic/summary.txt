Zlatan Ibrahimović (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈslɑːtan ɪbraˈhiːmɔvɪtɕ], Bosnian pronunciation: [zlǎtan ibraxǐːmoʋit͡ɕ]; born 3 October 1981) is a Swedish professional footballer who plays as a striker for French club Paris Saint-Germain and the Swedish national team for which he is captain.
Ibrahimović started his career at Malmö FF in the late 1990s before being signed by Ajax, where made a name for himself under Ronald Koeman. He later signed with Juventus for €16 million, and gained fame in Serie A by benefiting from his strike partnership with David Trezeguet. In 2006, Ibrahimović signed with rivals Internazionale, where he won individual awards such as the Italian Oscar del Calcio and the Swedish Guldbollen, and was named in the 2007 and 2009 UEFA Team of the Year, in addition to finishing as the league's highest scorer in 2008–09 while winning three straight Scudetti. In the summer of 2009, he transferred to Barcelona. His time at Barcelona was short-lived, however, moving back to Serie A football with A.C. Milan the following season, in a deal which made him one of the highest paid footballers in the world and cost the Italian club €24 million. He signed with Paris Saint-Germain in July 2012.
With his playing style compared to Dutch legend Marco van Basten, Ibrahimović is one of the best finishers in the game and is regarded to be one of the best footballers of his generation. His spectacular bicycle kick for Sweden against England won the 2013 FIFA Puskás Award for Goal of the Year. In December 2013, Ibrahimović was ranked by The Guardian as the third-best player in the world.
