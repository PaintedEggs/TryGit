Mario Götze (German pronunciation: [ˈɡœtsə]; born 3 June 1992) is a German footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Bayern Munich in the German Bundesliga. In addition to his favoured role as a number 10, Götze is capable of playing as either a left or right winger and also as a false 9. Götze is considered to be one of the sport's best young players, possessing speed, technique, dribbling skills, and play-making capabilities. In 2010, German Football Association's then technical director Matthias Sammer described Götze as "one of the best talents Germany has ever had."
Götze was first selected for the Germany national football team in 2010, at the age of 18. He was included in the squad for UEFA Euro 2012 and, two years later, scored the winning goal in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final.
Götze played for Borussia Dortmund between 2009 and 2013, winning the Bundesliga title in 2010–11 and the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double in 2011–12, and was a member of the team which reached the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. In April 2013, a €37 million bid from Bayern Munich triggered a release clause in Götze's contract, making Götze the second-most expensive German player to date, behind Mesut Özil.
